# Weather dashboard

Welcome to the weather dashboard.

Here is the URL: https://amiracat.github.io/weather-dashboard/

In this app, a user enters a city name, and the current weather and 5-day forecast is revealed using the Open Weather API.

Cities that have been searched are saved in a list on the left side, so the user can click back to those results, or clear the local Storage with the "clear history" button.

Looks like we're in for a cold spell.
